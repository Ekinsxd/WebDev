                    In order to create the grid, I split the rows into 4
                    sections and the columns into 4 sections. Using the
                    following css:
                    <b>
                        grid-template-columns: 3fr 1.5fr 4fr 1.5fr;
                        grid-template-rows: 100px 1fr 1fr 100px;
                    </b>
                    I was albe to allow the left side to have 30% of the area
                    and the right side to have 70% of the area. On the right
                    side i split up the areas into the remaining 7/10ths of the
                    area into 1.5, 4, and 1.5. This allowed me to have area 5
                    and 6 be 15% of the area and area 4 and 7 allowed to occupy
                    that 15% as well as the remaining 40% of the areaa. The tops
                    and bottoms were trivial to implement.
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>Area 1</b> was simple, using a class on the html element,
                    i allowed the element to occupy 100% of the area.
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>Area 2</b> was simple, only requiring text and a css
                    element to limit the height of the image. <br /><br />
                    <b>Area 3</b> is just text with headers and brs.
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>Area 4</b> is a table with table rows as chilren of the
                    table, and table data as children of the table rows. The
                    rows have alternating color by using tr:nth-child(odd) with
                    the background set to some color.The hover effect was done
                    in the same way, only selecting the tr subclass.
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>Area 5</b> is just an image with height and width set to
                    100%. <br /><br />
                    <b>Area 6</b> is an unordered list with the list items being
                    links. the links are created with the a tag and the href
                    attribute. <br /><br />
                    <b>Area 7</b> is just a large p tag with random b, i, and
                    code tags sprinkled in there. <br /><br />
                    <b>Area 8</b> is just a tags with href attributes linking to
                    other websites. The images are contained as children of the
                    a tags to inherit the href attribute.

                    According to all known laws of <b>aviation</b>, there is no
                    way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to
                    get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course,
                    flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is
                    impossible. In a world of constipation and diarrhea, it's
                    okay to be a normal piece of shit sometimes.
                    <b>118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you,</b>
                    stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is
